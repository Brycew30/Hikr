# Hikr

Hikr is a great central location for people around the U.S. to see different hikes where they live or may be travelling to!
Here, you'll find trail information, as well as reviews about other people's experiences on the trails!

## Getting Started
To use Hikr, clone this repo and install the required gems:
```
bundle install
```
Next, migrate the database:
```
rake db:migrate
```
Then, seed the database:
```
rake db:seed
```
Finally, start up the rails server:
```
rails s
```
See you on the trail sometime!
